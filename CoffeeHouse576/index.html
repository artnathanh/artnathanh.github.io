        <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
		<p>The Coffee Laboratory at Coffee House 576 is sourcing only the highest quality arabica bean from the mountains of Brazil, we are skilled at bringing out the perfect balance of flavors in the roasting process, and matching each order to the unique taste preferences of our customers.</p>

    <p>We love making coffee with a fair trade product and not just any beans will do. We consider the altitude where they are grown, the region of the country, and even the person farming them. That's why we invested with local Brazilian farmer, Carlos Alberto Torres, in a fair trade agreement to partner with his family and community to grow the best coffee bean in Brazil!</p>
